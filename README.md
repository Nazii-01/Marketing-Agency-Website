Welcome to the **Device Health Optimizer** landing page repository. This project introduces our cross-platform diagnostic tool that helps users monitor, understand, and maintain their deviceâ€™s health and lifespan.

Modern computers lose performance over time due to background processes, inefficient resource usage, and thermal stress. **Device Health Optimizer** tackles this by:

- Smart diagnostics (CPU, RAM, Disk, Battery, Temperature)
- Device lifespan prediction
- Real-time actionable tips
- Safe cleanup (rollback option)
- Idle app suspension suggestions
- Sustainability focus (reduce e-waste)

This repository contains the **landing page** for the app.
